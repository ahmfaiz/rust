# My Rust Learning Journey ðŸ¦€

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This repo contains all the code I write while learning Rust, including small projects, experiments, and exercises.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each project.

## Wanna check out something yourself?

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmfaiz/rust.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a project folder:
   ```bash
   cd hello_cargo    # Change folder name according to the project
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute if you'd like!
